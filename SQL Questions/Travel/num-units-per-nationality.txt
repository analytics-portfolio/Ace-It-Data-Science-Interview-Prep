Companies: Airbnb

We have data on rental properties and their owners.
Write a query that figures out how many different apartments (use unit_id) are owned by people under 30, broken down by their nationality.
We want to see which nationality owns the most apartments, so make sure to sort the results accordingly.

airbnb_hosts table:
