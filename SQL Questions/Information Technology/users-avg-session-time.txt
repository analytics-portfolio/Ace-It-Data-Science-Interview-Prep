Question: Users By Average Session Time 
Source: stratascrach

Calculate each user's average session time, where a session is defined as the time difference between 
a page_load and a page_exit. Assume each user has only one session per day. If there are multiple page_load 
or page_exit events on the same day, use only the latest page_load and the earliest page_exit, ensuring the 
page_load occurs before the page_exit. Output the user_id and their average session time.

worker table:
action:        text
timestamp:     timestamp without time zone
user_id:       bigint


--- SOLUTION ---
with user_session_len_by_date as (
    select
        t1.user_id, 
        t1.timestamp::date as session_date,
        min(t2.timestamp::TIMESTAMP) - max(t1.timestamp::TIMESTAMP) as session_len
    from facebook_web_log t1 
        join facebook_web_log t2
        on t1.user_id = t2.user_id
        where t1.action = 'page_load' and t2.action = 'page_exit' 
        and t2.timestamp > t1.timestamp
    group by t1.user_id, session_date
)

select
    user_id, 
    avg(session_len) as avg_session_len
from user_session_len_by_date
group by user_id

--- WALKTHROUGH ---
I would break down this problem into small manageable steps as the followings:
- The final output has each user_id with their average session time across dates.
- I start with computing the session length of each user on each day, then in the main query, 
I compute the average session length of each unique user.
