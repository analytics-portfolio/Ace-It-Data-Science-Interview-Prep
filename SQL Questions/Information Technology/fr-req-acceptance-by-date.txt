Question: Friend Request Acceptance Rate By Date 
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Meta

Calculate the friend acceptance rate for each date when friend requests were sent. 
A request is sent if action = sent and accepted if action = accepted. 
If a request is not accepted, there is no record of it being accepted in the table. 
The output will only include dates where requests were sent and at least one of 
them was accepted, as the acceptance rate can only be calculated for those dates. 
Show the results ordered from the earliest to the latest date.

fb_friend_requests table:
action:                 text
date:                   date
user_id_receiver:       text
user_id_sender:         text
