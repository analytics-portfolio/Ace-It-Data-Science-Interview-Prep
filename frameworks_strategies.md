# My Unconventional Strategy for Acing The Data Science Interview

With the current job markets are getting more competitive than ever, and meeting the qualifications alone is considered the minimum, how do we stand out and successfully ace those interviews?

Essentially, an interview is a sales process - the company is the buyer, and you are the seller of your values. In real life, deals are most often made when the buy side is convinced that they are getting a bargain for the price they pay. In this case, the company wants to hire the most valuable person, and you should provide them with such great value they cannot ignore you. 

If your value is 10x more valuable than the next person in line, you have such a leading edge among your competitors and even better, you could earn yourself a negotiation leverage. 

So how do we become the 10x version of yourself?

Here is my strategic approach in preparing a competitive profile to put yourself ahead of the game. 

Confidence comes from your own conviction - you are so convinced of yourself through the incredible things you did along the way. Build your stack of achievements.  
    - successfully Move (really) fast, failed three times and on to the fourth one when others are still thinking about their first move. 
    - Grind through the hard work even when you don't feel like it. Hold yourself accountable.

Here is the framework I use to ensure I answer the interview questions most effectively: 

1. **Ask clarifying questions:**
2. **Define problem boundaries:** Narrow down the problem scope. 
3. **Communicate with (not at) the interviewer:**
4. **Keep your priority straight:**
5. **Leverage frameworks and tools:**
